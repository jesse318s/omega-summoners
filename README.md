## _**PLEASE READ THIS TO COMPLETION!**_

### _**IMPORTANT NOTES**_ -

This project does not have a mongoDB connection setup.

- local development: create a .env file (make sure to name it .env), which exports your MONGO_URL connection. This file will be ignored by git so your db credentials will be kept safe when the app is deployed.

## Getting Started

Since this project will hold both the client application and the server application there will be node modules in two different places. First run `npm install` from the root.

### `yarn workspace server build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
